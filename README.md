## Steps ~~to~~ Followed

2. First of all, we created two branched, des and dev.
3. After that, the rough desgin was created in photoshop.
4. SVG icons were designed using illustrator and photoshop.
5. Now we will start coding using HTML, CSS, JS.
6. Drag of music from one place to dropping on dj pad, is the basic idea of our project.
7. This will also includes some animations on the page.
